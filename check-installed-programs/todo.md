# Check Installed Programs - Development Todo

## Project Overview

A comprehensive Windows program inventory tool that scans registry, Windows Store apps, and WMI for installed programs with drive analysis and dynamic progress tracking.

## Current Sprint

- [ ] Add program size estimation from registry data
- [ ] Implement program usage tracking (last accessed dates)
- [ ] Add program dependency analysis
- [ ] Create interactive filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Add export formats (JSON, XML, HTML report)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Basic registry scanning functionality
- [x] Windows Store app detection
- [x] WMI program detection with progress tracking
- [x] Drive selection menu and filtering
- [x] Dynamic progress bars for all scanning phases
- [x] Drive space analysis and reporting
- [x] Duplicate removal and consolidation
- [x] CSV and text report generation
- [x] Drive-based filtering of programs
- [x] Speed tracking for WMI operations (programs/sec)
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] User-friendly drive selection interface

## Enhancement Backlog

- [ ] Add program installation date analysis and statistics
- [ ] Implement program category classification (games, productivity, etc.)
- [ ] Add program version comparison and update recommendations
- [ ] Create program uninstall recommendations based on usage
- [ ] Add network location program detection
- [ ] Implement program licensing and compliance tracking
- [ ] Add integration with Windows Package Manager (winget)
- [ ] Create scheduled scanning and change detection

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] Implement parallel scanning for multiple registry paths
- [ ] Add caching mechanism for repeated scans
- [ ] Optimize WMI queries for better performance
- [ ] Add memory usage optimization for large program lists
- [ ] Implement incremental scanning for change detection

## Additional Features

- [ ] Add program icon extraction and display
- [ ] Implement program startup impact analysis
- [ ] Add program file association mapping
- [ ] Create program security scan integration
- [ ] Add program cleanup recommendations
- [ ] Implement program backup before uninstall
- [ ] Add program portability analysis

## Notes

- Drive analysis shows GB scanned per drive with usage percentages
- Progress tracking implemented for all major scanning operations
- WMI scanning includes speed calculation for performance monitoring
- Registry scanning processes multiple paths with detailed progress
- Drive selection allows targeted scanning to improve performance
- Comprehensive error handling ensures scan continues if some sources fail
