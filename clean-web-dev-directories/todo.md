# Clean Web Dev Directories - Development Todo

## Project Overview

A comprehensive web development directory cleanup tool that removes node_modules, build outputs, and cache directories with dynamic progress tracking and user-friendly interface.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Basic script structure and parameters
- [x] Core cleanup functionality implementation
- [x] Dynamic progress bars with size calculation
- [x] User interaction and confirmation prompts
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Colorized output for better UX
- [x] WhatIf support for safe testing
- [x] Multiple directory type support (node_modules, build, cache)
- [x] Real-time speed calculation during cleanup
- [x] Pre-calculation of directory sizes for accurate progress
- [x] Documentation and help system

## Enhancement Backlog

- [ ] Add support for more build output types (.svelte-kit, .vite, etc.)
- [ ] Implement parallel directory processing for faster cleanup
- [ ] Add configuration file support for custom directory patterns
- [ ] Create GUI version with Windows Forms
- [ ] Add scheduling capabilities for automated cleanup
- [ ] Implement backup/restore functionality before cleanup
- [ ] Add detailed reporting with file type breakdown
- [ ] Integration with package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm detection)

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] Optimize directory size calculation for large structures
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring during cleanup
- [ ] Implement chunked processing for very large projects
- [ ] Add multi-threading support for directory scanning

## Additional Features

- [ ] Add dry-run mode with detailed impact analysis
- [ ] Implement smart cleanup based on project age/usage
- [ ] Add integration with Git to respect .gitignore patterns
- [ ] Create PowerShell module version for easy distribution

## Notes

- Script handles nested node_modules correctly by excluding them from cleanup
- Progress bars show real-time MB/GB processed with speed calculation
- Comprehensive error handling ensures cleanup continues even if some directories fail
- All user interactions are intuitive with clear confirmation prompts
- WhatIf mode allows safe testing without actual deletion
